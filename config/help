JHop (Java Hop Engine) is an experimental search engine. JHop fulfills the following three operations which I the author consider 
qualify JHop as a search engine:

	1. Information Acquisition - Web Crawling
	2. Indexing & Ranking
	3. Information Retrieval - Searching and displaying web pages

JHop allows a user to build individual indexes to seperate information, as opposed to searching one cumulative index. Using JHop 
requires the user to instruct JHop to cary out each operation - that is to crawl, index, and search

JHop is best used as a command line tool by passing a string of arguments from within your chosen shell, for example:

java -jar JHop.jar --set {index_name} --search {search_term}

However JHop also provides an interactive command line tool similar to other programs such as fdisk etc.

CREATING AN INDEX

To create an index select option 2.

JHop will crawl web pages (and hop between references contained in web pages) to create an index. A user need not tell JHop to 
index responses, but only give the required information to start crawling the web. This includes:

	- The URL of the starting web page to crawl from.
	- A query to indetify which HTML branches contain the content to index.
	- A hop limit (The number of links to follow from the starting page).

*Note that specifying a hop limit of 0 will not perform any "hops" but still indexes and crawls the starting page*
 
The supplied query is an important detail, based on the query supplied JHop will select the content to index - this is to allow
control of skipping irrelevant content such as adverts and blob data. This means that you will need to know how to specify an
appropriate query for the target domain.

*Note links to external sites are not followed, e.g. a site on a different domain than the starting page*

A query consits of an attribute and value. For instance the following element has an attribute of id and a value of content:

<div id="content"> </div>

A query identifies the element to start crawling from, and only elements that are listed in './include' or match the given query
are included in the crawl. A crawl will stop following a branch of elements in the DOM when both conditions are false.

For example given the following response the lines marked with *'s will be crawled:

Query = class,content

Response = 
...
<body>
	<div class="container">
		<div class="content">
*			<p> ...
*			<ul>
*				<li>...
*			</ul>
*			<div class="content">
*				<p>...
*			</div>
			<div class="extra">
				<p>...
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="extra">
		</div>
	</div>
</body>

If you create an index and find very few results, or none at all, it will be because the query is invalid (no matching elements)
or exists to far up the DOM that no included elements are direct childs of the first match.

In general an easy way to create a query is as follows:

	1. Identify the included elements containing the desired content
	2. Identify their direct parent
	3. Identify an attribute and value contained in this parent
	4. Supply these two tokens as the attribute and value when prompted	

SEARCHING AN INDEX

To search an index select option 3 and identify the desired index name. If there are no results then no indexes exist an you 
should make one. Then select option 4 and supply the index name, proceeding to select option 1 and follow the prompts.

Note that if your terminal foes not support line wrapping (such as an IDE terminal) you can manually set the display width
in columns using option 6.

DELETING AN INDEX

To delete an option select option 5, this is the only command that does not provide output. Deleting an index that does not exist
does nothing. Otherwise the results canbe displayed by selecting option 3.

EXAMPLE INDEXES

A few example indexes have been supplied with JHop, they are described below:

	- CPP: some extracts from the C++ programming language reference. This is not the complete documentation.
	- Coronavirus: extracts from wikipedia pages related to Coronavirus(es).
	- Collections: extracts from the Java documentation on the JCF.

To see the options used to generate these indexes consult `./sets`.

To test the functionality of JHop the following is an example query to index the python 3 documentation at the time of writing:

	- URL: 		https://docs.python.org/3/library/array
	- Attribute: 	class
	- Value:	section
	- Limit: 	{Up to the user, recommended: 5-20}

*A note on code blocks: <code> and <pre> tags are not included in the default tag list as many webpages contain duplicate text
content when they are included. However if you would like to view code blocks add the relevant tage to the `include` file, that
is pre or code (most likely both)*
